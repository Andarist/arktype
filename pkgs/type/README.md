## Installation
Install the package using your favorite package manager:

```npm install @re-/type```


If you're using TypeScript, you'll need:
- TODO: TsConfig requirements?
- TODO: At least version 4.4.x?

## Creating your first type

```ts
import { parse } from "@re-/type"

// Most common TypeScript expressions just work...
const user = parse({
    name: {
        first: "string",
        middle: "string?",
        last: "string"
    },
    age: "number",
    interests: "string[]|null"
})

// You can create a TypeScript type in one line...
type User = typeof user.type

// That is totally equivalent to...
type RedundantUserDeclaration = {
    name: {
        first: string
        middle?: string
        last: string
    }
    age: number
    interests: string[] | null
}

// And can also validate your data at runtime...
const fetchUser = () => {
    return {
        name: {
            first: "Reed",
            last: "Doe"
        },
        age: 28,
        interests: undefined
    }
}

// TODO: Throws error...
user.assert(fetchUser())
```
