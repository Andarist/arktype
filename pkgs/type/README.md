## Installation

Install the package using your favorite package manager:

`npm install @re-/type`

If you're using TypeScript, you'll need:

-   TODO: TsConfig requirements?
-   TODO: At least version 4.4.x?

## Creating your first type

This snippet will give you an idea of `@re-/type` syntax, but the best way to get a feel for it is [in a live editor](https://TODO:updatelink). Try messing around with the `user` type and see how the type hints help guide you in the right direction.

```ts
import { parse } from "@re-/type"

// Most common TypeScript expressions just work...
const user = parse({
    name: {
        first: "string",
        middle: "string?",
        last: "string"
    },
    age: "number",
    interests: "string[]|null"
})

// If you're using TypeScript, you can create your type...
type User = typeof user.type

// And it will be totally equivalent to...
type RedundantUserDeclaration = {
    name: {
        first: string
        middle?: string
        last: string
    }
    age: number
    interests: string[] | null
}

// And can also validate your data at runtime...
const fetchUser = () => {
    return {
        name: {
            first: "Reed",
            last: "Doe"
        },
        age: 28,
        interests: undefined
    }
}

// Will throw: "At path interests, undefined is not assignable to any of string[]|null."
user.assert(fetchUser())
```

## Creating your first typeset

Your types can reference each other or themselves using a **typeset**. [Try it out](https://TODO:updatelink).

```ts
import { compile } from "@re-/type"

const typeset = compile({
    user: {
        name: "string",
        friends: "user[]",
        groups: "group[]"
    },
    group: {
        name: "string",
        description: "string",
        members: "user[]"
    }
})

// Definitions can be used the same way as those from "parse"
type User = typeof typeset.user.type

// Will throw: "At path friends/groups/0, 'Type Enjoyers' is not assignable
// to {name: string, description: string, members: user[]}"
typeset.user.assert({
    name: "Deven Aldai",
    friends: [
        {
            name: "Deven Alnyt",
            friends: [], // :(
            groups: ["Type Enjoyers"]
        }
    ],
    groups: []
})

// Types can also be accessed directly via the "types" prop
type Group = typeof typeset.types.group

// Typesets also include a parse function that allows references
// to the types you've defined alongside the built-in
// types available in an imported "parse"
const community = typeset.parse({
    users: "user[]",
    groups: "group[]",
    population: "number"
})
```

## Declarations

If you prefer to split up your typeset's definitions across one or more files, you'll want to use **declarations**. [Try it out](https://TODO:updatelink).

`index.ts`

```ts
import { declare } from "@re-/type"

// Declaring the names of the types you will define
// allows validation of references in your definitions
const declaration = declare("user", "group")

export const { define } = declaration

import { userDef } from "./user"
import { groupDef } from "./group"

// Type error: "Declared types 'group' were never defined."
const typeSet = compile(userDef)

// Creates a typeset identical to that of "Creating your first typeset"
const typeset = compile(userDef, groupDef)
```

`user.ts`

```ts
import { define } from "./index"

const badUserDef = define.user({
    name: "string",
    friends: "user[]",
    // Type error: "Unable to determine the type of 'grop'"
    groups: "grop[]"
})

export const userDef = define.user({
    name: "string",
    friends: "user[]",
    groups: "group[]"
})
```

`group.ts`

```ts
import { define } from "./index"

export const groupDef = define.group({
    name: "string",
    description: "string",
    members: "user[]"
})
```

## Syntax

`@re-/type` supports all of TypeScript's built-in types and lot of its most common type definition syntax. The following sections summarize the keywords and operators available by default in your definitions.

If the TS syntax you want to use is not listed here, feel free to create an issue summarizing your use case. Our model is easy to extend, so you might just get it ü§ì
